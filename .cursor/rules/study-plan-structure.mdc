# Study Plan Content Structure

## Source Document

All content should be parsed from [SnowPro_GenAI_Study_Plan_V2.md](mdc:docs/SnowPro_GenAI_Study_Plan_V2.md).

## Section Structure

The study plan has 7 main sections:
1. **Section 1** - Introduction (30 min)
2. **Section 2** - Domain 1.0: Snowflake for Gen AI Overview (3.0 h, 26% weight)
3. **Section 3** - Domain 2.0: Snowflake Gen AI & LLM Functions (4.5 h, 40% weight)
4. **Section 4** - Domain 3.0: Snowflake Gen AI Governance (2.0 h, 22% weight)
5. **Section 5** - Domain 4.0: Snowflake Document AI (1.5 h, 12% weight)
6. **Section 6** - Capstone: Document Processing Framework (2.0 h)
7. **Section 7** - Final Exam Prep (1.0 h)

## Content Elements to Extract

### For Each Section:
- **Lessons & Objectives**: List of lessons with their objectives
- **Reading (curated)**: Links to official Snowflake documentation
- **Hands-on**: Practice tasks and exercises
- **Practice Tasks**: Specific tasks to complete
- **Assignments**: Larger projects/assignments
- **Lab Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for capstone

### Key Patterns:
- Objectives are marked with **Objectives:** prefix
- Reading links are in bullet lists with URLs
- Practice tasks are in bullet lists
- Time estimates are in format like "3.0 h"
- Domain weights are percentages (26%, 40%, 22%, 12%)

## Display Guidelines

- Show time estimates prominently
- Display domain weights in progress indicators
- Make documentation links clickable (open in new tab)
- Use expanders for reading lists and practice tasks
- Track completion status for each section
- Show progress percentage based on completed sections

## Important Notes from Study Plan

- Prefer "Exam-Safe" (GA/Stable) features over "Latest/Preview"
- Document AI: Older `PREDICT` paths are deprecated, use AISQL functions
- Usage tracking: Use `CORTEX_AISQL_USAGE_HISTORY` (not older `CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_*` views)
- Model access: Use opt-out & DB roles, model-level RBAC is newer capability
- Always verify GA status before adopting preview features

## Data Models

When parsing the study plan, create data structures for:
- Section (with title, time, weight, objectives, readings, tasks)
- Objective (with description and related readings)
- Reading (with title and URL)
- Practice Task (with description and optional URL)
- Assignment (with description and deliverables)

## Content Enhancement Pattern

**Subdomain Content Structure:**
Each `Subdomain` dataclass should include:
- `title`: Subdomain title
- `objectives`: Learning objectives from study plan
- `readings`: List of Reading objects (documentation links)
- `key_points`: List of key points to remember (optional but recommended)
- `exam_focus`: Concise exam focus statement (optional but recommended)

**Key Points Format:**
- Use bullet points with **bold** for important terms
- Explain "when to use" each component
- Include configuration parameters and their purposes
- Reference specific functions, roles, or settings
- Keep each point focused and actionable
- **Match PDF Structure**: When the PDF study guide shows hierarchical structure, replicate it in key_points:
  - Use indentation (2 spaces) for nested items under parent categories
  - Parent categories should be bold (e.g., **Snowflake Cortex**)
  - Nested items use dashes and indentation (e.g., "  - **General functions**: ...")
  - Match the exact hierarchy and grouping from the PDF for consistency

**Exam Focus Format:**
- Single sentence summarizing what to remember for the exam
- Include key parameters, roles, or concepts
- Reference preview/GA status when relevant
- Keep it concise and memorable

**Example:**
```python
Subdomain(
    title="1. Principles, Features & Best Practices",
    objectives="Differentiate Cortex components...",
    readings=[Reading(...), ...],
    key_points=[
        "**AISQL**: SQL interface for LLM functions - Use for direct SQL queries",
        "**Cortex Analyst**: NL2SQL service - Use for natural language to SQL",
        ...
    ],
    exam_focus="Know when to use each component. AISQL = SQL, Analyst = NL2SQL, Search = RAG, Agents = automation.",
)
```

## Page Rendering Pattern

**Enhanced Subdomain Display:**
1. Show objectives clearly
2. Display exam focus prominently (if provided)
3. List key points in expandable sections
4. Provide reading resources with links
5. Reference study plan documents at page top

**Study Plan References:**
- Always include reference to source documents at page top
- Link to both Study Plan V2 markdown and official PDF
- Show exam weight and time estimates
- Provide context about exam coverage
