# Study Plan Content Structure

## Source Document

All content should be parsed from [SnowPro_GenAI_Study_Plan_V2.md](mdc:docs/SnowPro_GenAI_Study_Plan_V2.md).

## Section Structure

The study plan has 7 main sections:
1. **Section 1** - Introduction (30 min)
2. **Section 2** - Domain 1.0: Snowflake for Gen AI Overview (3.0 h, 26% weight)
3. **Section 3** - Domain 2.0: Snowflake Gen AI & LLM Functions (4.5 h, 40% weight)
4. **Section 4** - Domain 3.0: Snowflake Gen AI Governance (2.0 h, 22% weight)
5. **Section 5** - Domain 4.0: Snowflake Document AI (1.5 h, 12% weight)
6. **Section 6** - Capstone: Document Processing Framework (2.0 h)
7. **Section 7** - Final Exam Prep (1.0 h)

## Content Elements to Extract

### For Each Section:
- **Lessons & Objectives**: List of lessons with their objectives
- **Reading (curated)**: Links to official Snowflake documentation
- **Hands-on**: Practice tasks and exercises
- **Practice Tasks**: Specific tasks to complete
- **Assignments**: Larger projects/assignments
- **Lab Steps**: Step-by-step instructions for capstone

### Key Patterns:
- Objectives are marked with **Objectives:** prefix
- Reading links are in bullet lists with URLs
- Practice tasks are in bullet lists
- Time estimates are in format like "3.0 h"
- Domain weights are percentages (26%, 40%, 22%, 12%)

## Display Guidelines

- Show time estimates prominently
- Display domain weights in progress indicators
- Make documentation links clickable (open in new tab)
- Use expanders for reading lists and practice tasks
- Track completion status for each section
- Show progress percentage based on completed sections

## Important Notes from Study Plan

- Prefer "Exam-Safe" (GA/Stable) features over "Latest/Preview"
- Document AI: Older `PREDICT` paths are deprecated, use AISQL functions
- Usage tracking: Use `CORTEX_AISQL_USAGE_HISTORY` (not older `CORTEX_FUNCTIONS_*` views)
- Model access: Use opt-out & DB roles, model-level RBAC is newer capability
- Always verify GA status before adopting preview features

## Data Models

When parsing the study plan, create data structures for:
- Section (with title, time, weight, objectives, readings, tasks)
- Objective (with description and related readings)
- Reading (with title and URL)
- Practice Task (with description and optional URL)
- Assignment (with description and deliverables)
